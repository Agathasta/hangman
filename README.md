# Hangman Game
[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/file-i-o-and-serialization-ruby-programming)

Hangman Game: you have 6 turns to guess a word.
Enter a letter, it doesn't matter if up or downcase.
You can save the game at any point typing 'save'
(this exercise was about serialization).

Enjoy!
