# Hangman Game
[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/file-i-o-and-serialization-ruby-programming)

You have 6 turns to guess a 5 - 12 letter word randomly chosen
by the computer from a dictionary.

It is a command line game. You can play it online at [repl.it](https://repl.it/@Agathasta/hangman#README.md). 

Click on the green 'run' button at the top of the page.
Enter a letter, it doesn't matter if up or downcase.
You can save the game at any point typing 'save'
(this exercise was about serialization).

Enjoy!
